- Detects liquid spills of many types (milk, water, oil, soda, yogurt, honey, detergent, juices, etc.) using HSV + texture rules.
- Detects hazardous objects in warehouses (boxes, pallets, carts, blocked pathways, blocked panel/extinguisher) using YOLO + proximity heuristics.
- Highlights spills with a semi-transparent overlay and draws color-coded bounding boxes for hazards.
- Placeholder camera support (captures snapshots every 10s) ‚Äî disabled on Streamlit Cloud; use Docker/local for live camera demos.

- The spill detector is heuristic-based (color + low-texture + morphology). It covers a wide range of liquids/colors but is not a trained segmentation model ‚Äî for production-level accuracy you would collect labeled spill images and train a segmentation model.
- The warehouse obstruction heuristics are conservative: they look for objects occupying central walking paths or near edges (possible exit obstruction). Tune `min_spill_area` in the sidebar for sensitivity.
- If you want fully offline startup (no model download), add `yolov8n.pt` to the repo root before deploying.
