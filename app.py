- Detects a wide variety of spills (milk, water, soda, oil, yogurt, honey, detergent, juices, etc.) using HSV + texture heuristics.
- Detects common warehouse obstructions (boxes, pallets, carts, people blocking central paths) using a pretrained YOLO + proximity heuristics.
- Highlights spills with a semi-transparent overlay and draws color-coded bounding boxes for hazards.
- Camera/live features are placeholders on Streamlit Cloud (use Docker/local for camera demos).

- This app uses heuristic spill detection (color + texture + morphology) plus a pretrained YOLOv8n model for object detection. Heuristics greatly improve recall for many liquid types but are not a replacement for a trained segmentation model.
- For production-level claimable accuracy you should collect labeled data and train a segmentation model ‚Äî the app is structured so you can swap in custom model weights later.
- To avoid cloud binary installation problems the code lazy-loads heavy native packages only when needed; errors (if any) will be visible in the app logs.
